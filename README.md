# MyDiscordBot
This is a dicord bot that I am making using discord.py.
It is for me and my friends to use on our server and it is to help me get a better understanding with Python because I really only know Java and C# along with some C++.
I have a .gitignore file for my local repository so it doesn't give the token for my bot publicly.
